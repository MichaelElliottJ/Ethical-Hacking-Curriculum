# Week 5: Introduction to Malware and Viruses

# Understanding Malware Types

## 1. Viruses
- **Definition**: Programs that attach themselves to legitimate files and replicate when the file is executed
- **Example Types**:
  - File Infector Viruses
  - Macro Viruses
  - Boot Sector Viruses
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a harmless "virus" that demonstrates replication without causing damage

## 2. Worms
- **Definition**: Self-replicating programs that spread across networks without user interaction
- **Characteristics**:
  - Spread through network vulnerabilities
  - Can consume bandwidth
  - Often used for DDoS attacks
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a network-aware program that demonstrates worm-like behavior

## 3. Trojans
- **Definition**: Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software
- **Common Types**:
  - Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
  - Banking Trojans
  - Downloader Trojans
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a harmless program that demonstrates how Trojans can hide their true purpose

## 4. Ransomware
- **Definition**: Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption
- **Characteristics**:
  - File encryption
  - Payment demands
  - Time limits
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a program that demonstrates encryption without actual file locking

## 5. Spyware
- **Definition**: Software that secretly collects user information
- **Types**:
  - Keyloggers
  - Screen capture
  - Data collection
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a program that demonstrates how spyware might collect information

## 6. Adware
- **Definition**: Software that displays unwanted advertisements
- **Characteristics**:
  - Pop-up ads
  - Browser redirects
  - Unwanted toolbars
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a program that demonstrates ad injection

## 7. Rootkits
- **Definition**: Malware that hides its presence from the operating system
- **Types**:
  - Kernel-level rootkits
  - User-mode rootkits
  - Bootkit rootkits
- **Safe Demo**: We can create a program that demonstrates process hiding
